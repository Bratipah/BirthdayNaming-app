This website is  about a Ghana naming culture whereby we use gender inputs,birthday dates to determine the name and the day of the week of the user.It also is calculated using the gender basis and birthday date.

## Demo
Here is a working live demo : https://bratipah.github.io/Naming-app/
 



## BDD(Behavioural Driven Development)
An Akan Naming app gives a user a Ghanian name after the user has inputed their birthday date.This birthday date has a format displayed in a form for input and a label indicating the date format for the user to enter through.In case the user doesnt fill up the form a message is displayed for them to enter the required date needed.After the input of birthday date the user is prompted to choose their gender either male or female through a select option.For the user to be able to see their Akan Name correspondence they have to click on the submit button where the Name pops up;Satsifying the objective of the Naming App project.
Here is a an example Of the Input,example,Output,result.
